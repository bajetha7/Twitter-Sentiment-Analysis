# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Dataset provided as a practice challenge in Analytics Vidhya Platform.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.


## Data Files
 

train.csv - For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.
There is 1 test file (public)

test_tweets.csv - The test data file contains only tweet ids and the tweet text with each tweet in a new line.

## Evaluation Metric:

The metric used for evaluating the performance of classification model would be F1-Score.
The metric can be understood as -

 

True Positives (TP) - These are the correctly predicted positive values which means that the value of actual class is yes and the value of predicted class is also yes.

True Negatives (TN) - These are the correctly predicted negative values which means that the value of actual class is no and value of predicted class is also no.

False Positives (FP) – When actual class is no and predicted class is yes.

False Negatives (FN) – When actual class is yes but predicted class in no.

Precision = TP/TP+FP

Recall = TP/TP+FN

 F1 Score = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)

 F1 is usually more useful than accuracy, especially if for an uneven class distribution.
